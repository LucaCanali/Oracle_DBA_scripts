# OraLatencyMap ‚Äî Oracle Wait and I/O Latency Heatmaps

**This is a copy from the official repository for OraLatencyMap: https://github.com/LucaCanali/OraLatencyMap/**
  
**OraLatencyMap** is an Oracle RDBMS performance troubleshooting tool.
It helps DBAs and performance engineers drill into wait-event and I/O latencies.
It captures wait-event histograms from the database and renders them as **heat maps** directly in
your terminal. Runs from CLI with SQL\*Plus, 

---

## ‚ú® Why latency histograms and why two heat maps?

Oracle instrumentation provides **detailed latency histograms** for wait events, sampled at the microsecond level.
This is precious when using just wait averages makes it hard to understand a multi-modal distribution (e.g., a mix of fast and slow I/Os).
Heat maps are a great way to visualize histograms over time.
OraLatencyMap does just that. It runs from Oracle CLI, SQL*PLus, and samples Oracle‚Äôs **wait histograms** and renders two views:

1) **Frequency heat map** ‚Äî *How often* waits occur in each latency bucket (Hz).
2) **Intensity heat map** ‚Äî *How much time* those waits consume (ms/sec).

These two views answer different questions:

- **‚ÄúAre many calls slow?‚Äù** ‚Üí Frequency map
- **‚ÄúAre a few slow calls dominating total time?‚Äù** ‚Üí Intensity map

A common pattern: 90% of reads are served from storage cache with latency < 1 ms (bright band in the *frequency* map),
but a small tail around 10 ms (I/O served by slow spindles) paints the *intensity* map hot‚Äîmeaning that tail dominates
user-visible delay. 
You need **both** maps to see the full picture

## üöÄ Quick Start

    -- Connect to Oracle via SQL*Plus
    $ sqlplus system/password@service

    -- Basic wrapper with sensible defaults
    SQL> @OraLatencyMap

    -- @OraLatencyMap [seconds] ["wait event"]
    SQL> @OraLatencyMap 3 "db file sequential read"

    -- Commit latency example
    SQL> @OraLatencyMap 5 "log file sync"

---

## üîß Advanced Mode

Use the advanced mode when you want full control over sampling period, canvas geometry, or optional filters:

    -- Usage:
    -- @OraLatencyMap_advanced <refresh_sec> "<event_name>" <num_bins> <num_cols> "<extra_where>"

    -- Examples:
    SQL> @OraLatencyMap_advanced 5 "db file sequential read" 11 90  "and inst_id=1"
    SQL> @OraLatencyMap_advanced 5 "log file sync"           13 110 "and inst_id in (1,2)"

**Arguments**

| Arg | Meaning | Tips |
|---|---|---|
| `<refresh_sec>` | Seconds between samples/frames | 3‚Äì10s is a good start. Higher reduces overhead and jitter. |
| `"<event_name>"` | Exact non-idle wait event (case-insensitive) | e.g., `db file sequential read`, `log file sync`, `db file scattered read` |
| `<num_bins>` | Heat map **rows** (latency buckets) | More rows = finer latency detail; 11‚Äì15 is typical |
| `<num_cols>` | Heat map **columns** (time window width) | 80‚Äì120 columns balance detail and readability |
| `"<extra_where>"` | Extra predicate appended to `GV$` filters | Use for RAC: `and inst_id=1` or `and inst_id in (1,2)`; or targeted tests |

**When to use Advanced Mode**
- You want a wider/narrower time window or more latency granularity.
- You need to focus on a subset of instances in RAC.
- You‚Äôre presenting data on a larger terminal (more columns/rows).

> Note: The simple wrapper fixes geometry and proxies to advanced mode.  
> For custom bins/cols or filters, call **`@OraLatencyMap_advanced`** directly.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Run from **SQL\*Plus** in a terminal that supports **ANSI escape codes** (xterm, PuTTY, most modern terminals).
- Privileges:
  - `SELECT` on `GV$EVENT_HISTOGRAM_MICRO` (or `V$...` in single instance)
  - `EXECUTE` on `DBMS_LOCK` (used for sleep)
- Oracle versions: tested on **19c, 23ai**
  - For Oracle 11g, use version 1.2
 
---

## üß≠ Reading the Heat Maps

- **Axes**:
  - Y = latency buckets (ms; sub-ms appear as decimals; the lowest is `<0.128`)
  - X = time, newest at the **right** (scrolling right‚Üíleft)

- **Frequency map** (top): ‚Äúhow many waits?‚Äù  
  Watch for skew: stripes/bands indicate stable distributions; sudden vertical streaks indicate bursts.

- **Intensity map** (bottom): ‚Äúhow much time is lost?‚Äù  
  A small hot band at higher ms means a tail that‚Äôs killing throughput, even if rare.

**Common patterns**
- **Bimodal I/O**: two horizontal bands (e.g., SSD vs. spinning disk) ‚Üí verify storage tiers.
- **Commit stalls** (`log file sync`) spiking into 5‚Äì20 ms ‚Üí check redo I/O latency, log buffer pressure, or contention.
- **Sustained drift upward** ‚Üí storage contention or throttling; correlate with system metrics.

## Example Output
![Latency reads heatmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucaCanali/OraLatencyMap/master/Latency_reads_heatmap.png)

This example shows the latency heatmap for the `db file sequential read` event.  
The system is experiencing a **bimodal latency distribution**, indicating two distinct latency patterns:

- Reads from **fast storage (SSD)** with latency < 1 ms (visible in the *Frequency Heatmap*, blue area).
- Reads from **slower storage (spinning disks)** with latency ‚âà 10 ms (visible in the *Intensity Heatmap*, yellow-red areas).

Although most requests are served in under 1 ms, the slower I/Os with latency around 10 ms contribute a significant share
of the **total wait time**.

Note you can use [ehm_micro.sql](https://github.com/LucaCanali/Oracle_DBA_scripts/blob/master/ehm_micro.sql) to further analyze the latency distribution:

```
@ehm_micro 10 "db file sequential read"

Latency histograms for Oracle wait events, RAC 12c version.
Usage: @ehm_micro <delta time> <event>
Please wait for 10 sec (DeltaT = 10 sec) for snapshot N.2 and script output.

## üß™ Practical Workflows

- **Single-block reads (OLTP)**  
  `@OraLatencyMap 3 "db file sequential read"`  
  If the *intensity* map is hot around ~8‚Äì12 ms, a minority of slow reads is likely the bottleneck.

- **Commit latency**  
  `@OraLatencyMap 5 "log file sync"`  
  Spikes here are user-facing. Investigate `redo write` latency, log file size/placement, IOPS saturation.

- **RAC focus**  
  `@OraLatencyMap_advanced 5 "db file sequential read" 11 90 "and inst_id=1"`  
  Compare nodes side by side in separate sessions.

- **Deeper drill-down**  
  Pair with script [ehm_micro.sql](https://github.com/LucaCanali/Oracle_DBA_scripts/blob/master/ehm_micro.sql)
  to print the numeric histogram and last-update timestamps.

---
## üê≥ Testing using Oracle-free container image

You can try **OraLatencyMap** without access to a production Oracle database by using the
[Oracle Free container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gvenzl/oracle-free).  
This image includes **Oracle Database**, **SQL\*Plus**, and is ideal for functional testing or demos.

**Setup**

```bash
# Start Oracle Free 23c container
docker run -d --name mydb1 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=oracle -p 1521:1521 gvenzl/oracle-free:23.9-slim

# Open a shell inside the container
docker exec -it mydb1 /bin/bash

# Connect as SYSDBA
sqlplus / as sysdba
```

From SQL\*Plus you can, for example, run `DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER.CALIBRATE_IO` to generate I/O activity:

```sql
DECLARE
  l_latency PLS_INTEGER;
  l_iops    PLS_INTEGER;
  l_mbps    PLS_INTEGER;
BEGIN
  DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER.calibrate_io (
    num_physical_disks => 4,
    max_latency        => 10,
    max_iops           => l_iops,
    max_mbps           => l_mbps,
    actual_latency     => l_latency
  );
  DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('Max IOPS = ' || l_iops);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('Max MBPS = ' || l_mbps);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('Latency  = ' || l_latency);
END;
/
```

**Measure with OraLatencyMap**

```bash
# Clone OraLatencyMap locally and copy into the container
git clone https://github.com/LucaCanali/OraLatencyMap
docker cp OraLatencyMap mydb1:/opt/oracle

# Back inside the container
docker exec -it mydb1 /bin/bash
sqlplus / as sysdba

-- Run the example, it will sample I/O waits "Disk file I/O Calibration" every 3 seconds
@OraLatencyMap/Example4_calibrate_io.sql
```

This workflow lets you quickly validate the scripts and visualize latency heat maps in a safe, self-contained environment.

## üßØ Troubleshooting

- **No color/garbled output**: use a terminal with ANSI support; avoid character translation.
- **ORA-01031 / missing view**: grant `SELECT` on `GV$EVENT_HISTOGRAM_MICRO`; grant `EXECUTE` on `DBMS_LOCK`.
- **Blank maps**: the event may be idle, mistyped, or inactive; try a busier event or longer sampling.
- **RAC totals look odd**: filter by `inst_id` to isolate nodes; tails can differ across instances.
